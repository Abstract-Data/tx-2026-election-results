- **Flipped Districts**: Gained 3 districts (HD 141, HD 140, CD 29, SD 13) from Democrat/competitive to Republican

### Democrat Opportunities
- **HD District 31**: Flipped from Republican to Democrat (largest Democrat gain)
- **Competitive Districts**: 20 total competitive districts across all types where targeted outreach could shift outcomes

## Methodology Notes

### Net Change Calculation
Net change represents the difference between expected party composition (based on old district boundaries) and actual party composition (based on new district boundaries). A positive shift indicates Republican advantage increased; negative indicates Democrat advantage increased.

### Competitive Districts
Districts are classified as competitive if:
- Both parties have between 45-55% of the vote, OR
- The margin between parties is 10 percentage points or less

### Vulnerabilities
- **Competitive Districts**: Vulnerable to shifts based on turnout and modeled voter behavior
- **High Modeled Voters**: Districts with >50,000 modeled voters (voters with general election history but no primary history) are at higher risk of unpredictable outcomes

---

## Recommendations

### For Republicans
1. **Defend Flipped Districts**: Focus resources on HD 141, HD 140, CD 29, and SD 13 to maintain newly gained advantages
2. **Protect Competitive Districts**: 20 competitive districts need strong turnout and voter engagement
3. **Monitor Modeled Voters**: Districts with high numbers of modeled voters require targeted outreach

### For Democrats
1. **Recapture Flipped Districts**: HD 141, HD 140, CD 29, and SD 13 are critical targets
2. **Defend HD 31**: Protect the district that flipped from Republican to Democrat
3. **Target Competitive Districts**: 20 competitive districts offer opportunities for gains
4. **Engage Modeled Voters**: Focus on districts with high numbers of modeled voters to shift outcomes
