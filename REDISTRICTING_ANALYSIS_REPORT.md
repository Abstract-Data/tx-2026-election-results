# Redistricting Analysis Report - By District Type

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of redistricting impacts across three district types: Congressional Districts (CD), State Senate Districts (SD), and House Districts (HD), comparing 2022 boundaries to 2026 boundaries.

**Total Voters Analyzed:** 18,663,050

**Competitiveness Threshold:** 57% (districts with ≥57% of known party voters for one party are "Solidly" that party; otherwise "Competitive")

### Data Source Note

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This analysis is currently based **ONLY on known primary voters** (voters who have voted in Republican or Democrat primaries in the last 4 election cycles). 

- **Known Primary Voters:** 853,308 (4.6% of all voters)
  - Republican primary voters: 544,675 (63.8% of known)
  - Democrat primary voters: 308,633 (36.2% of known)
- **Not Included:** 17,809,744 voters (95.4%) who have not voted in primaries but may have voted in general elections

The competitiveness analysis and party composition calculations use only these known primary voters. A future analysis with ML-modeled party predictions for general-election-only voters would provide a more complete picture and may change competitiveness classifications for some districts.

## Key Findings and Implications

### Overall Trends
1. **Competitiveness Changes:** 
   - **Net gain of 10 competitive districts** across all types (from 16 to 26 total)
   - State Senate districts saw the largest increase in competitive districts (+6, from 0 to 6)
   - Congressional districts tripled their competitive districts (from 1 to 3)
2. **Republican Advantage:** 
   - **Net gain of 14 solidly Republican districts** across all types
   - House districts show the largest shift (+10 R districts)
   - All district types show net Republican gains, with the advantage increasing as district size decreases
3. **Democrat Districts:** 
   - **Net loss of 32 solidly Democrat districts** - significant reduction
   - House districts lost the most (-18 D districts)
   - Congressional districts lost nearly half their solidly D districts (from 15 to 8)
4. **Voter Movement:** Significant voter movement (31-39%) across all district types, indicating substantial boundary changes
5. **Concentration:** Republican gains appear more concentrated in fewer districts, while Democrat changes are more distributed

### Implications
- **Congressional Districts:** Tripled competitive districts (from 1 to 3), but still low overall (7.9%)
- **State Senate:** Created 6 competitive districts from 0 - significant change, highest percentage competitive (19.4%)
- **House Districts:** Largest absolute shifts (+10 R, -18 D), but competitive districts only increased by 2 (from 15 to 17)

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Voter File:** November 2024 Texas voter registration file
- **District Boundaries:** 2022 (old) and 2026 (new) shapefiles
- **Analysis Date:** Based on existing analysis files (November 6, 2025)
- **Total Voters:** 18,663,050 registered voters
- **Competitiveness Threshold:** 57% of known party voters (R+D only)

### Current Analysis: Known Primary Voters Only

**Data Coverage:**
- **Known Primary Voters:** 853,308 (4.6% of all voters)
  - Voters who have voted in Republican or Democrat primaries (2024, 2022, 2020, 2018)
  - Republican primary voters: 544,675 (63.8% of known)
  - Democrat primary voters: 308,633 (36.2% of known)
- **Not Currently Included:** 17,809,744 voters (95.4%)
  - Voters who vote in general elections but not primaries
  - Voters with no voting history
  - Swing voters (those who voted in both R and D primaries are classified separately)

**Impact on Analysis:**
- Competitiveness classifications are based on a very small subset of voters (4.6%)
- Party composition percentages reflect only known primary voters
- Districts with many general-election-only voters may have dramatically different competitiveness if modeled data were included
- **95.4% of voters are unclassified**, meaning competitiveness assessments are based on less than 5% of the electorate

### Potential Impact of ML-Modeled Data

**Current Limitation:** The analysis uses only **4.6% of voters** (known primary voters) for Congressional Districts. The remaining **95.4% of voters** are unclassified.

If ML predictions were included for general-election-only voters, we would expect:

1. **More Complete Party Classifications:**
   - Could classify an additional ~17.8 million voters (95.4% of total)
   - Would provide party predictions for voters based on:
     - Geographic patterns (precinct, county, ZIP code party composition)
     - Demographic patterns (age, age bracket party composition)
     - Primary voting history patterns (for voters with some but not complete primary history)

2. **Potential Changes to Competitiveness:**
   - **Districts with many general-election-only voters might shift categories**
   - More districts might become competitive if general-election voters have different party preferences than primary voters
   - Some solidly R/D districts might become competitive, or vice versa
   - **Districts with <10% known primary voters would see the largest impact**

3. **More Accurate District Composition:**
   - Party percentages would reflect a much larger portion of the electorate (potentially 50-70% instead of 4-14%)
   - Better representation of actual voter preferences in each district
   - More reliable competitiveness assessments

### Comparison: Known-Only vs. Modeled Data Analysis

| Metric | Known Primary Voters Only (Current) | With ML-Modeled Data (Potential) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Voters Classified** | 853K (4.6%) | ~10-13M (50-70%)* |
| **Data Source** | Primary voting history only | Primary history + ML predictions |
| **Coverage** | Limited to primary voters | Includes general-election voters |
| **Competitiveness Accuracy** | Based on small sample | Based on larger, more representative sample |
| **District Coverage** | All districts, but incomplete | All districts with fuller data |

*Estimated based on typical ML model performance and general-election voter patterns

**Note:** The ML modeling pipeline (steps 12-15) has been implemented but not yet executed. Once run, it will:
- Train an XGBoost model on known primary voters using geographic and demographic features
- Predict party affiliation for general-election-only voters
- Generate updated competitiveness assessments with ML-enhanced data
- Provide a more complete picture of district competitiveness

### Districts Most Likely to Change with Modeled Data

Many districts have very low percentages of known primary voters, meaning their competitiveness classifications could change significantly with ML-modeled data:

**Congressional Districts with <5% Known Primary Voters:**
- District 33: 2.6% known (97.4% unknown) - 338,231 unclassified voters
- District 35: 3.1% known (96.9% unknown) - 325,108 unclassified voters  
- District 20: 3.2% known (96.8% unknown) - 483,812 unclassified voters
- District 29: 3.5% known (96.5% unknown) - 905,885 unclassified voters
- District 3: 3.5% known (96.5% unknown) - 640,949 unclassified voters

These districts have **96-97% of their voters unclassified**, meaning their competitiveness assessments are based on only 3-4% of their electorate. ML modeling would provide predictions for the remaining 96-97% of voters, potentially significantly changing their competitiveness classifications.

**Recommendation:** Run the full pipeline (steps 12-15) to generate ML predictions and create an updated analysis with modeled data included. This would provide a more accurate and complete assessment of district competitiveness, especially for districts with low primary voter participation.

## Notes

- **Percentages are calculated based on known party voters (Republican + Democrat) only**, excluding Swing and Unknown voters
- **Net changes represent the difference between 2022 and 2026 district assignments**
- **Full district-by-district data available in CSV files** in `data/exports/districts/`
- **Modeled voter columns exist in CSV files but are currently all zeros** - indicating ML predictions have not been generated yet
